        <h1>Retirement Boarding</h1>
    <p>Stony Brook Farm offers both stall and field board for equine retirement at a separtate facility located across the street from our public facility. Amenities include an insulated eight stall barn that retains a warm temperature during winter months and always has a cool breeze during summer months. Stalls are 12' x 12', deeply bedded and have heated, automatic water fountains. Two spacious turn out fields offer lush pasture, fresh water that is heated in the winter, and 12' X 24" run ins which are cleaned regularly. </p>
    <p>Your retiree will be cared for as one of our own. Blanket changes, fly spray/ sunscreen (provided by owner), a feeding program catered to your horse's needs, and management of farrier and veterinarian appointments are just a few items included in your board. Additionally, Stony Brook can provide grooming and bathing and any extra attention necessary as specified by the owner. </p>
    <p>Your senior horse will enjoy a quiet and peaceful retirement with all the spoils they deserve and you will enjoy the peace of mind of knowing your best equine companion is comfortable and well cared for.
