            <h1>Boarding</h1>
            <p>Stony Brook Farm employees take pride in being friendly, detail oriented, highly motivated horse people. We offer show barn level care without the show barn atmosphere. Your horse will be cared for as if it were one of our own; blanket changes, application of fly spray/ sunscreen (owner supplied), scheduling and holding for the farm farrier, and a feeding program catered to the needs of your horse are just a few of the many services included in the board rate. Our goal is to keep your horse happy and healthy so you are able to enjoy your time in the barn and in the saddle to the fullest extent!</p>
